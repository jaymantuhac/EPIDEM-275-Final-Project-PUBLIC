# EPIDEM-275-Final-Project-PUBLIC
The following repo contains materials and code used in my final project for EPIDEM 275 (Bioinformatics) at UC Irvine (Spring Quarter 2021). 

The primary scientific question of interest for this project is the following: Given 23andMe data from Harvard University's Personal Genome Project (PGP) database, a publicly available database of voluntarily submitted genomes, what diseases/traits are individuals be at most risk for? 

Please note that due to the sensitive nature of this project due to the use of individual-level data, some code has been censored to protect the identities of the subjects that I have selected.
